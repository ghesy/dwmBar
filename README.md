# soystemd's dwmbar

`dwmbar` is a status bar for [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org)
similar to [dwmblocks](https://github.com/torrinfail/dwmblocks).

this build replaces newline characters with space,
so the spaces between command outputs come naturally.

checkout [my dotfiles](https://github.com/soystemd/dotfiles)
for the dwmbar-* scripts.
