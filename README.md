# soystemd's dwmbar

`dwmbar` is a status bar for [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org)
similar to [dwmblocks](https://github.com/torrinfail/dwmblocks).

It's multithreaded, fast and lightweight, and easy to configure.

I cleaned up this build a lot, completely removed
the internal modules, and visually restructured the code.

This build also replaces the newline characters
in your module scripts' outputs with a space,
so the spaces in your bar output can come naturally.

for my [bar module scripts](https://github.com/soystemd/dotfiles/tree/master/scripts/.local/bin/dwmbar).
